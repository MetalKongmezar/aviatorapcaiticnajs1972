## Introduction to Aviator

Aviator is not your typical slot game. This crash game features a unique
mechanic where players bet on how high the multiplier will climb before
the airplane flies away. The excitement lies in the need to cash out
your winnings before the plane leaves the screen. The longer the plane
flies, the higher the multiplier, which can lead to substantial payouts.
